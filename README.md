# ECS189G-Project

ECS189G is a Deep Learning upper division course we covered important topics such as:
 - basic math, optimization, machine learning background knowledge
 - neural network basics, error backpropagation algorithm
 - auto-encoder model for data encoding and re-construction
 - convolutional neural network (CNN) for computer vision
 - recurrent neural network (RNN) for natural language processing
 - graph neural network (GNN) for network embeddings
 - graph-bert and GResNet

There were individual assignments and a group-level programming project (this project)

Stage 1: Group formation and programming environment setup. (0%)
Stage 2: First trial with PyTorch and build up a Multi-Layer Perceptron model to classify the instances in a provided dataset. (10%)
